Online Quiz Portal

This is a project I created for VU Students to practice lecture wise quizzes of their subjects to prepare for quiz assignments and exams. But due to the lack of time, I could not create enough data, however the project is complete with its structure, so if anyone who can add the data, can surely give this a go. 

Its a ready made project for an online quiz portal system with full admin panel to monitor and control everything. Its built on codeigniter and designed with bootstrap to be 100% responsive.
